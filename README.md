# WIKI-PSE
## A Wikipedia-based resource for Probing Semantics in word Embeddings


### Data
For looking only into the (word, semantic-classes) datasets, please look into this directory:
[dataset](https://github.com/yyaghoobzadeh/WIKI-PSE/tree/master/dataset).

All WIKI-PSE files, includingincluding the corpus and trained embeddings can be dowloaded from this link:

[data.zip](http://cistern.cis.lmu.de/WIKI-PSE/data.zip)

After unzipping the data.zip, in the root, "corpus.txt" is the corpus we used to train word embeddings (e,g, "@apple@").

In "word_sclass" subdirectory, there is another "corpus.txt". This one is used to train (word, semantic-class) embeddings (e.g., "@apple@-organization").
